## Can you write in MDX and use a GraphQL page query in MDX?

Yes you can! This page is an MDX file that is exporting metadata through a const and through a GraphQL export query. This page also uses a default export, so it won't take on the default layout set by the gatsby-config file.

### Where do I start with this nested file?

The documentation offers guides for all different skill levels, you can

gasby-config.js file ensuring that the FAQ component isn't wrapped
by other elements -->
