## Can you write more MDX and import a separate MDX file?

Yes you can! This page is an MDX file that is importing another MDX file. This page uses a default export, so it won't take on the default layout set by the gatsby-config file.

This page is also exporting metadata through a const and through a GraphQL export query. Need to double check this one.

### And a CodePen embed

<CodePen codePenId="eYOQQxY" />

### Where is the imported shortcode?

It is imported right below this. Good times.

<!-- This default export overrides the default layout set in the
gasby-config.js file ensuring that the FAQ component isn't wrapped
by other elements -->

Passing children into the `<ThisIsMdx/>` component/shortcode below does nothing, because it is an MDX file.

<ThisIsMdx children={`Testing456`}>Testing 123</ThisIsMdx>

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>

  query MyMoreMDXQuery {
    allMdx {
      edges {
        node {
          frontmatter {
